<p align="center">üìù My personal blog, made with <a href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola</a></p>

üèÅ The site is optimized to load as fast as possible. It uses [WebP
images](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp) when supported, and loads a
trimmed down custom build of the [Iosevka font](https://typeof.net/Iosevka/) I
did with FontTool's
[pyftsubset](https://fonttools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subset/) following [this
example](https://xeiaso.net/blog/iaso-fonts).

It does not have many features so far, as the idea is to keep adding more when
the need arises. Right now, it includes:

* Post list pagination
* Code snippets with copy to clipboard function
* Auto image resizing and WebP conversion
* A cool [RSS feed](https://blog.meneillos.com/atom.xml) using XSL styles!

Head to [TODO.md](TODO.md) for a list of things I plan to add eventually.

Feel free to use this as inspiration to create your own blog (or just copy it
without mercy).
